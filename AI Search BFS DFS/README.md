# AI Search - BFS and DFS

This program solves a maze by finding a path from start to end.  
It demonstrates two common search algorithms: **BFS** and **DFS**.

## What it does
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search) finds the **shortest path**.  
- **DFS** (Depth-First Search) finds a path (not always shortest).  
- Plots the maze and shows BFS and DFS paths visually.  
- Prints the paths as coordinates in the console.

## Real-life examples
1. **Robot navigation** in a room to find the shortest path.  
2. **Puzzle solving**, like sliding puzzles or game AI.  
3. **Pathfinding in games** to move characters from point A to B.

## What we learn
- How computers **search step by step** in a structured environment.  
- Difference between **BFS and DFS** in pathfinding.  
- Basics of **AI problem-solving** and grid-based search.
