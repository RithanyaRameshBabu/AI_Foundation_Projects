# Linear Regression

This program fits a line through points using **gradient descent**.  
It finds the slope (w) and bias (b) that best predict the data.

## What it does
- Creates points using `y = 3x + 5 + some noise`
- Finds the best slope (w) and bias (b)
- Shows a line that fits the points
- Shows how error (loss) decreases over time

## Real-life examples
1. Predicting house prices using house size, number of bedrooms, and location  
2. Forecasting temperature next week using previous temperatures and humidity

## What I learned
- How a computer can learn a line from data  
- How slope and bias influence predictions  
- How **gradient descent** improves the line step by step
