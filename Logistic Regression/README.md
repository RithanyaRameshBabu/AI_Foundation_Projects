# Logistic Regression

This program predicts yes or no for given data points.  
It shows the probability for each point and how the model learns over time.

## What it does
- Uses a sigmoid curve (S-shape) to model probabilities
- Predicts 0 or 1 for binary outcomes
- Shows a decision boundary line
- Shows how loss decreases over epochs

## Real-life examples
1. Detecting email spam based on words and links  
2. Predicting if a customer will leave a service using usage data

## What we learn
- How classification works in AI  
- How probability is used for predictions  
- How loss decreases during model training
