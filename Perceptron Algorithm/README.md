# Perceptron Logic Gates

This program implements a **perceptron** to learn **basic logic gates** (AND, OR, NAND) from scratch using Python and NumPy.  
It predicts outputs for all possible 2-input combinations and visualizes the **decision boundaries**.

## What it does
- Implements a **perceptron learning algorithm** from scratch  
- Trains the perceptron for **AND, OR, and NAND gates**  
- Prints **predictions, weights, and bias** for each gate  
- Visualizes **training points** and **decision boundaries**  
- Shows how the perceptron separates 0 and 1 classes in 2D

## Real-life examples
1. Foundations of **linear classifiers** in machine learning  
2. Understanding **binary classification** problems  
3. Step toward building **neural networks for more complex tasks**

## What I learned
- How a **perceptron learns linear patterns**  
- How **weights and bias** determine decision boundaries  
- How **linear separability** works for simple datasets  
- How to **visualize training points and decision boundaries** to understand learning
